/**
 * <code>PresentationTerminatedEvent</code> is generated when the
 * presentation of a service terminates.  This includes both normal
 * termination (e.g., due to an application calling the <code>stop()</code>
 * method) and abnormal termination (e.g., due to some change in the
 * environment). Examples of abnormal termination include:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>a tuning operation making the service unavailable </li>
 *
 * <li>removal of fundamental resources required to present the
 * service</li>
 *
 * <li>withdrawal of CA authorization</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <code>PresentationTerminatedEvent</code> is also generated
 * following a <code>SelectionFailedEvent</code> either if the service
 * context was not previously in the <em>presenting</em> state or if
 * recovery of what was being presented previously is not possible.
 * <code>PresentationTerminatedEvent</code> is only generated when no
 * components of the requested service can be presented.  <p>
 *
 * Once this event has been generated, a <code>ServiceContext</code>
 * will be in the <em>not presenting</em> state until a call to a
 * <code>select()</code> method succeeds.  When this event is
 * generated, all resources used for the presentation have been
 * released, and <code>ServiceContentHandler</code> instances
 * previously associated with the <code>ServiceContext</code> will
 * have ceased presentation of their content.
