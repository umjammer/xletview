/**
 * The <code>CarouselFile</code> class represents
 * file or directory data obtained from broadcast file systems.  An
 * instance of <code>CarouselFile</code> may be constructed from a
 * <code>Locator</code> instance or via constructors similar to those
 * of <code>java.io.File</code>.<p>
 *
 * Application classes implementing the
 * <code>CarouselFileListener</code> interface may subscribe with the
 * <code>CarouselFile</code> to receive notification of changes to the
 * file in the broadcast.  Upon the occurrence of a change, the
 * <code>CarouselFile</code> notifies subscribed
 * <code>CarouselFileListener</code> instances via
 * <code>CarouselFileChangeEvent</code> objects.<p>
 *
 * Successful instantiation of a <code>CarouselFile</code> object
 * causes its broadcast filesystem to be dynamically "mounted" in the
 * local filesystem.  The precise mount point can be determined by
 * calling <code>getCanonicalPath()</code> on the
 * <code>CarouselFile</code> instance representing the top-level
 * directory of the carousel.<p>
 *
 * Construction of a <code>CarouselFile</code> object causes its
 * contents to be loaded asynchronously from the broadcast stream.
 * Subsequent attempts to read the data of a <code>CarouselFile</code>
 * object will block until its contents are loaded.<p>
 *
 * Broadcast file data for which there are no remaining
 * <code>CarouselFile</code> instances or open file descriptors are
 * eligible for unloading from the cache.  Broadcast carousels for
 * which there are no remaining <code>CarouselFile</code> instances or
 * open file descriptors are eligible for unmounting from the local
 * filesystem.<p>
 *
 * Java TV API implementations that do not support broadcast
 * filesystem access will throw <code>IOException</code> upon any attempt
 * to construct a <code>CarouselFile</code> object.
