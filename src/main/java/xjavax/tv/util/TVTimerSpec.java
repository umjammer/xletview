/**
 * A class representing a timer specification.
 *
 * A class representing a timer specification. A timer specification declares
 * when a <code>TVTimerWentOffEvent</code> should be sent. These events are
 * sent to the listeners registered on the specification.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>TVTimerSpec</code> may be <b>absolute</b> or <b>delayed</b>.
 * Absolute specifications go off at the specified time. Delayed specifications
 * go off after waiting the specified amount of time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Delayed specifications may be repeating or non-repeating. Repeating
 * specifications automatically reschedule themselves after going off.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Repeating specifications may be regular or non-regular. Regular
 * specifications attempt to go off at fixed intervals of time, irrespective of
 * system load or how long it takes to notify the listeners. Non-regular
 * specifications wait the specified amount of time after all listeners have
 * been called before going off again.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, you could create a repeating specification that goes off every
 * 100 milliseconds. Furthermore, imagine that it takes 5 milliseconds to
 * notify the listeners every time it goes off. If the specification is
 * regular, the listeners will be notified after 100 milliseconds, 200
 * milliseconds, 300 milliseconds, and so on. If the specification is
 * non-regular, the listeners will be notified after 100 milliseconds, 205
 * milliseconds, 310 milliseconds, and so on.
 * </p>
