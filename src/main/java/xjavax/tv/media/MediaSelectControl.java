 *
 * Instances of <code>MediaSelectControl</code> may be obtained from a

 * <code>getControl(String)</code> and <code>getControls()</code>.
 * Note that a Java TV API implementation may not always or ever
 * support <code>MediaSelectControl</code> for a given Player; in such
 * a case, the failure modes specified by the two aforementioned
