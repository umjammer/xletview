/**
 * The <code>PushSourceStream2</code> interface identifies a
 * <code>SourceStream</code> that pushes asynchronous data.
 *
 * <p> Note that a <code>PushSourceStream2</code> provides no
 * guarantees of the length of time that incoming data will be
 * buffered before being discarded or overwritten with new data.
 * Because of the time-dependent nature of the stream, clients should
 * read the pending data immediately upon notification.
 *
 * <p> This interface is functionally identical to
 * <code>javax.media.protocol.PushSourceStream</code>, except that it
 * provides the <code>readStream()</code> method that throws
 * exceptions.  Instances of <code>PushSourceStream2</code> may be
 * obtained through the JMF method
 * <code>javax.media.protocol.PushDataSource.getStreams()</code>.  In
 * Java TV implementations, objects returned by this method will be of
 * type <code>PushSourceStream2</code>.  Instances of
 * <code>PushDataSource</code> are obtained by means of
 * <code>javax.media.Manager.createDataSource(javax.media.MediaLocator)</code>.
 * If access to broadcast asynchronous data is not supported by the
 * system, this method will throw
 * <code>javax.media.NoDataSourceException</code>.
