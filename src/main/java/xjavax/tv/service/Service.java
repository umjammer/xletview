/**
 * The <code>Service</code> interface represents an abstract view on
 * what is generally referred to as a television "service" or
 * "channel". It may represent an MPEG-2 program, DVB service, an ATSC
 * virtual channel, SCTE virtual channel, etc. It represents the basic
 * information associated with a service, such as its name or number,
 * which is guaranteed to be available on the receiver. <P>
 *
 * Internal to the receiver, each service is uniquely identified by
 * information that may include system type, network ID, transport stream
 * ID, service number, service number, or other information. This
 * identification is encapsulated by the Locator object. <P>
 *
 * Note that a <code>Service</code> object may represent multiple
 * instances of the same content delivered over different media
 * (e.g., the same service may be delivered over a terrestrial and
 * cable network). A <code>ServiceDetails</code> object represents a
 * specific instance of such content which is bound to a specific
 * delivery mechanism. <P>
 *
 * The information available through this object, i.e., the service name,
 * service number, etc., represents information that is stored in
 * the receiver and is not necessarily the same as what is broadcast in any
 * broadcast service information protocol. For example, a receiver
 * implementation may let the end user edit this information according to
 * the user's preferences. <P>
 *
 * A <code>Service</code> object may optionally implement an interface
 * that supports service numbers.  Each <code>Service</code> object
 * must provide either a service name (via the <code>getName</code> method)
 * or a service number (via the <code>ServiceNumber</code> interface).
 * <A HREF="../../../javax/tv/service/ServiceNumber.html"><CODE>ServiceNumber</CODE></A>,
