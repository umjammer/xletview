/**
 * <code>NormalContentEvent</code> is generated to indicate that the
 * normal content of a service is being presented. This event will be
 * generated in two situations: <ul>
 *
 * <li>
 * At the end of a successful service selection operation, this
 * event will be generated as long as all of the service components
 * being presented are part of the normal content of the service. The
 * generation of this event in this situation signals a change in
 * state of the service context from the <em>presentation pending</em>
 * state to the <em>presenting</em> state. If even one of the service
 * components being presented is alternative content (as defined in
 * <code>AlternativeContentEvent</code>) then that event will be
 * generated instead.
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>
 * During the presentation of a service, this event will be generated
 * if alternative content was being presented and all of that
 * alternative content is replaced by content which is a normal part
 * of the service.  An example of this is when an
 * end user completes a pay per view dialog the video
 * advertising a service is replaced by the service itself.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
