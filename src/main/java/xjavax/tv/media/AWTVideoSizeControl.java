/**
 * <code>AWTVideoSizeControl</code> allows setting clipping, scaling, and
 * translation of a video stream in a simple, interoperable way.  Not
 * all possible combinations of positioning will be supported, so this
 * interface provides a mechanism to discover how closely the
 * underlying platform will approximate a request for positioning.
 *
 * <p> All interactions via AWTVideoSizeControl happen in the
 * coordinate space of the screen.  For example, successfully setting
 * the video's position to the location reported by
 * <code>Component.getLocationOnScreen()</code> on the
 * <code>Xlet</code>'s root container will cause the upper left-hand
 * corner of the video and the root container to coincide.  <p> The
 * screen, in the context of AWT, is the area into which graphics
 * drawing operations are done.  Its size is given by
 * java.awt.Toolkit.getScreenSize(), and locations reported by
 * Component.getLocationOnScreen() are given in the screen's
 * coordinate system.<p>
 *
 * Instances of <code>AWTVideoSizeControl</code> may be obtained from
 * a JMF <code>Player</code> via the methods
 * <code>getControl(String)</code> and <code>getControls()</code>.
 * Note that a Java TV API implementation may not always or ever
 * support <code>AWTVideoSizeControl</code> for a given Player; in
 * such a case, the failure modes specified by the two aforementioned
 * methods will apply.
 * <CODE>java.awt.Component.getLocationOnScreen()</CODE>,
