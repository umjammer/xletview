/**
 * <code>SIChangeEvent</code> objects are sent to
 * <code>SIChangeListener</code> instances to signal detected changes
 * in the SI database.<p>
 *
 * Note that while the SI database may detect changes, notification of
 * which specific <code>SIElement</code> has changed is not guaranteed.
 * The entity reported by the method <code>getSIElement()</code> will
 * be either:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The specific SI element that changed, or<p>
 * <li>An SI element that contains, however indirectly, the specific SI
 * element that changed, or<p>
 * <li><code>null</code>, if the specific changed element is unknown.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The level of specificity provided by the change mechanism is
 * entirely dependent on the capabilities and current resources of the
 * implementation.
 *
 * <code>SIChangeEvent</code> instances also report the kind of change
 * that occurred to the SI element, via the method
 * <code>getChangeType()</code>:
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>An <code>SIChangeType</code> of <code>ADD</code> indicates that
 * the reported SI element is new in the database.<p>
 *
 * <li>An <code>SIChangeType</code> of <code>REMOVE</code> indicates
 * that the reported SI element is defunct and no longer cached by the
 * database.  The results of subsequent method invocations on the
 * removed SIElement are undefined.<p>
 *
 * <li>An <code>SIChangeType</code> of <code>MODIFY</code> indicates
 * that the data encapsulated by the reported SI element has changed.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * In the event that the SIElement reported by this event is not
 * the actual element that changed in the broadcast (i.e. it is
 * instead a containing element or <code>null</code>), the
 * <code>SIChangeType</code> will be <code>MODIFY</code>.
 * Individual SI element changes are reported only once, i.e.,
 * a change to an SI element is not also reported as a change
 * to any containing (or "parent") SI elements.
