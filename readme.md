## Requirements:

- Sun's sdk 1.4

## Install:

- Put the files where you want them.
- Double click on xletview.jar (Windows) or run from console
  If you do the double clicking you will not get debug output. So if you want to see
  your "sysouts" you have to run from console
(If you have Sun's sdk 1.4 but not as the default runtime you need to start from console)
- Some settings can be changed in config/settings.txt
